#  Lava Lamp NXTHEME Files

------ NEEDS UPDATE ------
on Progress.


Update version Checklist:
- Update to 15.X so all the "folders" work. Using the good work of Soda.
- Edit all the possible editable colors from Common and AllApps to match the astethic of the theme. Thanks Capybara.
- Remove the need for PSDS; (Everything on the screen including panels, shadows etc. will be all rendered in Switch via the current BLFYT and not via JPEG.)
- Remove the Non-Banned versions. (After the feedback i got, i realised almost everyone using the theme wasnt using them, because go figure, they wouldnt need to access the online resources...)
- Add a few minor animations.

Hey Lads, sometime ago i saw this post on the r/nintendoswitch:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/pqpdaa/a_couple_of_weeks_ago_i_shared_my_redesign_of_the/

And i decided to try and make this mockup a layout/theme as close as possible. (Even with the actual switch limitations).

After a few weeks of trial and error and a lot of errors, i think i got something worth sharing.

Everything was resized and not scaled so it gets the smooth and clean round look.
For this theme you need a few things:

1. Sys-Tweak to change and put your own custom game icons (needed for the vertical layout)
2. The icons itself, they are scaled at 2/3 and i strongly recommend you to use IconGrabber by u/Slluxx, you can download and set the icons within the App itself, and follow his project, some awesome new things comming soon: https://gbatemp.net/threads/icongrabber-custom-game-icons-theme-teaser.592902/ (There is also a version for the Homelayout and AllApps with 1:1 ratio icons that doenst need Systweak of this tool).
3. At least 13 games installed or a few bugs might occur.
4. Font is Coolvetica
5. A bit of patience üòÅ
